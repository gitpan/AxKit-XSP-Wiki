AxKit::XSP::Wiki
================

This is an AxKit XSP based Wiki.

At the moment it only allows you to write Wiki pages in POD (some
may consider this a good thing). However in the future I'm sure it
will support regular Wiki-text.

It supports multiple Wikis (via multiple databases). Each Wiki can
have an infinite number of pages (up to 2G database).

Installation requires a working AxKit install, and a httpd with
.htaccess enabled for the directory you want your Wiki in.

After doing the regular "make install" for the module, simply copy
the files in webstuff to the directory you want your Wiki in. Make
sure you also copy the .htaccess file too.

That's all - you should be able to point the browser at the directory
where the Wiki is, and you'll be up and running.

Edit the XSL stylesheets to your heart's content.
